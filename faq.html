                      We believe sound risk management using stop losses. To that end, we require a stop loss on every trade. If you fail to place a stop loss at the time of placing the trade/order, we will close the trade. This is only a soft breach rule, so you can continue trading in your account.                    </p>

                      We require all trades to be closed by 3:45pm EST on Friday. Any trades left open after this time will automatically be closed. Note, this is only a soft breach and you will be able to continue trading once the markets reopen.                    </p>

                      Upon passing your Assessment, you will receive an email with instructions on how to access and complete your Trader Agreement. Once the agreement is completed and supporting documentation is provided, your Live Account will be created, funded and issued to you typically within 24-48 business hours.

                    <p>
                      Once you pass the Assessment, we provide you with a live account, backed by our capital. The capital in your Live Account is notional and may not match the amount of capital on deposit with the Broker. A Live Account is notionally funded when actual funds in the account (i.e., the equity in a Live Account represented by the amount of capital) differs from the nominal account size (i.e., the size of the Live Account that establishes the initial account value and level of trading). Notional funds are the difference between nominal account size and actual capital in a Live Account.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                      Use of notional funding does not change the trading level or that the account may trade in any manner differently than if notional funds were not used. In particular, the same conditions and rules applicable to a soft breach, hard breach, Daily Loss Limit, Max Trailing Drawdown, stop loss and position limits apply.

                    <p>
                      No. We operate at an arm's length with the Broker. All market pricing and trade executions are provided by the Broker and are not changed or modified by us. Additionally, we do not mark up transaction costs established by the Broker through adjusting bid-offer spreads, markups/markdowns, commission charges or swaps.

                      <p>
                        For purposes of managing risk and minimizing transaction costs, we may offset or negate market risk and act as the direct
                        counterparty to certain trades initiated in the Account. Such trades are executed at prices provided by the Broker. This
                        framework is intended to ensure you receive real market execution on your trades, while simultaneously allowing us
                        to manage risk dynamically by routing existing positions or future orders to third parties for execution as we deem
                        appropriate. We believe that such real market execution and dynamic risk management would not be possible or as cost-
                        effective if trades were executed in simulated accounts. Regardless of whether we act as counterparty to your trades, the
                        gain or loss on your Live Account is not calculated differently. However, when we act as the counterparty to your trades,
                        there is an inherent potential conflict of interest because your trades do not result in net gain or loss to us, as your trades
                        would if we were not the direct counterparty.

                        Traders can request a withdrawal of the gains in their Live Account at any time in their trader dashboard, but no more
                        frequently than once per thirty (30) days. So, if you make gain in your Live Account, you can request a withdrawal.
                        When you are ready to withdraw the gains from your Live Account, click the Withdrawal button in your trader
                        dashboard and enter the amount to withdraw. Once your withdrawal request is approved, we will pay the monies owed
                        to you via your selected method.

                        Your first withdrawal can be requested at any time. Thereafter, you can request a withdrawal of the gains in your
                        account every 30 days. When a withdrawal is approved, we will also withdraw our share of the gains, and your max
                        trailing drawdown will lock in at your starting balance. The trailing drawdown does not reset when you request a
                        withdrawal. Example: You have taken an account from $100,000 to $120,000. You then request a withdrawal of
                        $16,000. In this scenario, you will receive $12,000 and we would retain $4,000. This would also take the balance of the
                        account down to $104,000, and your Maximum Trailing Drawdown is locked in at $100,000. So, you would have $4,000
                        maximum you could lose on the account before it would violate the Maximum Trailing Drawdown rule. If you take a full
                        withdrawal of the gains in your Live Account, the Maximum Trailing Drawdown will still lock in at the starting balance
                        and will therefore result in the forfeiting of your Live Account, as your balance will trigger the Maximum Trailing
                        Drawdown breach rule.
