                                          Once you pass the Assessment, we provide you with a live account, backed by our capital. The capital in your Live Account is notional and may not match the amount of capital on deposit with the Broker. A Live Account is notionally funded when actual funds in the account (i.e., the equity in a Live Account represented by the amount of capital) differs from the nominal account size (i.e., the size of the Live Account that establishes the initial account value and level of trading). Notional funds are the difference between nominal account size and actual capital in a Live Account.

                                          Use of notional funding does not change the trading level or that the account may trade in any manner differently than if notional funds were not used. In particular, the same conditions and rules applicable to a soft breach, hard breach, Daily Loss Limit, Max Trailing Drawdown, stop loss and position limits apply.

                                          For purposes of managing risk and minimizing transaction costs, we may offset or negate market risk and act as the direct
                                          counterparty to certain trades initiated in the Account. Such trades are executed at prices provided by the Broker. This
                                          framework is intended to ensure you receive real market execution on your trades, while simultaneously allowing us

                                          effective if trades were executed in simulated accounts. Regardless of whether we act as counterparty to your trades, the
                                          gain or loss on your Live Account is not calculated differently. However, when we act as the counterparty to your trades,

                                          trailing drawdown will lock in at your starting balance. The trailing drawdown does not reset when you request a
                                          withdrawal. Example: You have taken an account from $100,000 to $120,000. You then request a withdrawal of
                                          $16,000. In this scenario, you will receive $12,000 and we would retain $4,000. This would also take the balance of the
                                          account down to $104,000, and your Maximum Trailing Drawdown is locked in at $100,000. So, you would have $4,000
                                          maximum you could lose on the account before it would violate the Maximum Trailing Drawdown rule. If you take a full
                                          withdrawal of the gains in your Live Account, the Maximum Trailing Drawdown will still lock in at the starting balance
                                          and will therefore result in the forfeiting of your Live Account, as your balance will trigger the Maximum Trailing
                                          Drawdown breach rule.

                                          The Daily Loss Limit is the maximum your account can lose in any given day. Daily Loss Limit is calculated using the
                                                previous day balance which resets at 5 PM EST. Unlike other firms, we do NOT base our calculations on previous day
                                                equity since the balance only model allows you to scale gains without fear of losing your account. The Daily Stop
                                                compounds with the increase in your account.

                                                Example: if your prior day's end of day balance (5pm EST) was $100,000, your account would violate the daily stop loss limit if your equity reached $95,000 during the day. If your floating equity is +$5,000 on a $100,000 account, your new-day (5pm EST) max loss is based on your balance from the previous day ($100,000). So, your daily loss limit would still be $95,000.

                                          The Maximum Trailing Drawdown is initially set at 6% and trails (using CLOSED BALANCE - NOT equity) your account
                                                until you have achieved a 6% return in your account. Once you have achieved a 6% return the Maximum Trailing
                                                Drawdown no longer trails and is permanently locked in at your starting balance. This allows for more trading
                                                flexibility.

                                                Example: If your starting balance is $100,000, you can drawdown to $94,000 before you would violate the Maximum
                                                Trailing Drawdown rule. Then for example let's say you take your account to $102,000 in CLOSED BALANCE. This is your
                                                new high-water mark, which would mean your new Maximum Trailing Drawdown would be $96,000. Next, let's say you
                                                take your account to $106,000 in CLOSED BALANCE, which would be your new high-water mark. At this point your
                                                Maximum Trailing Drawdown would be locked in at your starting balance of $100,000. So, regardless of how high your
                                                account goes, you would only breach this rule if your account drew back down to $100,000 (note, you can still violate
                                                the daily drawdown). For example, if you take your account to $170,000, as long as you do not drawdown more than 5%
                                                in any given day, you would only breach if your account equity reaches $100,000.
